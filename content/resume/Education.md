      Winner of a scholarship for the development of a research activity entitled "3D Cartography with Blender".

      The research consist in the use of the open-source software Blender for the production of 3D cartographic elaborations of some prototype areas. In the grant will be carried out the methodological insights on 3D representation techniques, with comparison of paper and computer representations, evaluating the technical aspects and graphic rendering. It will be also evaluated how to implement visualizations with Blender starting from standard cartographic data at national level (City of Turin, Piedmont Region, ...). Finally, a practical manual will be prepared.

      During the research I processed nadiral and oblique frames to obtain textured 3D models of urban areas. These processes were carried out with the software: 3DF Zephyr, PhotoMesh and Metashape.
      I used TerraExpolorer to carry out 3D analyses on the generated models and to create a presentation highlighting their potential.
      These models have been imported in syGlass to be visualized, in virtual reality (VR), with HP Reverb G2 VR Headset visors.

      The activity was carried out under the scientific direction of Prof. Gabriele Garnero - of the Interateneo Department of Science, Planning and Territorial Policy - for a duration of two months.
