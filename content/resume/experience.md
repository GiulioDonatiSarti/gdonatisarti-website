      Assignment for the realization of hillshades to be used as a base for hiking maps at 1:25,000 scale.
      These elaborations are made with different techniques, developed in Blender and Photoshop, which make the morphology of the landscape more readable and, at the same time, the final maps more attractive.

      During the working relationship I was responsible for experimenting with new techniques for representing the landscape elements.

        Responsibilities include:
        * Analysing
        * Modelling
        * Deploying

      Winner of a scholarship for the development of a research activity entitled "3D Cartography with Blender".

      The research consist in the use of the open-source software Blender for the production of 3D cartographic elaborations of some prototype areas. In the grant will be carried out the methodological insights on 3D representation techniques, with comparison of paper and computer representations, evaluating the technical aspects and graphic rendering. It will be also evaluated how to implement visualizations with Blender starting from standard cartographic data at national level (City of Turin, Piedmont Region, ...). Finally, a practical manual will be prepared.

      During the research I processed nadiral and oblique frames to obtain textured 3D models of urban areas. These processes were carried out with the software: 3DF Zephyr, PhotoMesh and Metashape.
      I used TerraExpolorer to carry out 3D analyses on the generated models and to create a presentation highlighting their potential.
      These models have been imported in syGlass to be visualized, in virtual reality (VR), with HP Reverb G2 VR Headset visors.

      The activity was carried out under the scientific direction of Prof. Gabriele Garnero - of the Interateneo Department of Science, Planning and Territorial Policy - for a duration of two months.

      Experimentation of three-dimensional (3D) cartographic representation with Blender.

      The project was structured in five macro-phases: (i) download, selection and organization of the necessary geographic data (raster and vector), (ii) creation of the data processing flow in FME (Feature Manipulation Engine) to make data compatible with Blender, (iii) creation of scripts to automate the import of geographic data into Blender, (iv) setting up the scene to be rendered with Cycles and (v) insertion of toponymy and post-processing in Illustrator and Photoshop.

      Collaborator in the realization of the Topographic Map at scale 1:25.000 covering the entire region of Tuscany.

      In particular I have been involved in the graphic editing process, taking care of the transition from GISs software to programs typical of digital graphics processing (Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop).

      Moreover, I have experimented and applied the principles of selection and graphic positioning of toponymy.
